        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat.

        <li>Stir in tomato paste; cook, stirring constantly, until tomato paste has slightly darkened in color, about 2 minutes. Stir in beef broth, using a spatula to scrape any browned bits from bottom of pan. Stir in ketchup, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, sugar, garlic powder, and black pepper until fully combined. Bring to a boil over medium-high, and cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce thickens and bubbles appear all over the surface, about 7 minutes. Remove from heat, and transfer to the prepared baking dish.
